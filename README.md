I designed a Tamagotchi virtual pet game that will be played by users. The game will have the user interact with their virtual pet, this includes taking care of the pet as if it was a living pet making sure that the pet is clean, happy and fed. The player will have to keep a close eye on the pet’s status and to regularly check up on the pet to make sure that it is healthy.

I used android studio to design the user interface, the game is designed to look appealing to the users so that they are intrigued by the game and its stylish design and colors that correspond with each other. from elegant typography to thoughtful use of spaces, every element of the user interface has been thoughtfully designed to enhance the user experience and facilitate effortless interaction. The application is designed to be interactive and responsive so that the user finds it easy to play. first, I had to figure out what the user interface will look like, planning to write pseudocode and drawing flowcharts and using programming logic on how I was going to build the application. Using programming logic and following syntax rules to design the application for the user. after working out the details of how the game was going to look like I made a list of steps I was going to take and from there I followed the steps to build the Tamagotchi application using different sources and researching how to implement different codes making sure they work, debugging the application so that it works without issues.
Using android studio to develop the application was easy as the android studio platform was user friendly and developing and the platform also offers GitHub and other user integrated development systems to make it easier for developers to use the platform from beginners to professionals.

 
. GitHub and GitHub Actions

throughout the process of app building, I used GitHub to make the process, I used GitHub to version control and to ensure that my code is reliable and that it had no errors. Using GitHub I created a repository where all my updates of the code were committed and updated, tracked.it allowed me to create separate files to test out new features or fix bugs without changing the code and risking everything falling apart. Then, once I was confident everything was good to go, I could merge my changes back into the main code.
. Using GitHub
 it was helpful when I was working on my code. It helped me keep everything organized. easy save the changes I made and track them over time. I was able to make changes to my code on the get go, I updated my changes easily. This made it easier for me and what I was working on. It let me try out new coding lines without making any changes to my code so I could avoid making unwanted errors on my code or making the code that was working previously and not work anymore due to unforeseen errors. it allowed me to create separate files to test new files and fix bugs without worrying about breaking anything. If the code was updating is working without any error, I could update my changes back into the main code anytime I wanted to. But GitHub wasn't just about coding on my own, it had some features that allowed for working with my classmates. It also allowed us to talk about our projects, give each other feedback on our code, and keep track of any problems we encountered. It really helped us work together more effectively. It made everything way easier to handle and improved how well I could work with my friends.

I conducted manual testing as I was making changes to my code to make sure the application will work the way it is intended to. The testing was to make sure that the application works seamlessly and offers enjoyable educational experience for students. testing was utilized so that the application will run without any problems so that the user gets a finished product that runs without any errors. The version control from GitHub Actions has been an important tool for making the development processes easier. By making the workflows and triggers, I used automated tasks on my code and deployment, testing and reducing the work that was going to be used manually work and making development much more faster and it saved me a lot of time.it made deploying updates to my code simple and easy, GitHub Actions has helped me to work on my code and update it whenever I wanted to and making while it reliable and improving workflow.
